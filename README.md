1. Introduction: ESP32-Apple-HomeKit-Smart-Home-DIY-Switch-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor
üöÄ In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to set up a DIY smart switch &amp; and temperature &amp; humidity sensor module for a typical bedroom ‚Äî with 2 light switches and 1 temperature &amp; humidity sensor ‚Äî all connected directly to Apple HomeKit. No hub required! üî•

What you‚Äôll be able to do:
‚úÖ 2 physical light switches (works with both switch & Home app)
‚úÖ Temperature & humidity sensor for real-time room monitoring
‚úÖ Direct Apple HomeKit integration ‚Äî works with Siri voice control
‚úÖ 100% local network setup, fully private & secure

You don‚Äôt need to be an expert in coding or electronics. I explain everything clearly so anyone can follow along.

üìå What you‚Äôll learn in this video:
‚Ä¢ How to configure an ESP32 as a HomeKit device
‚Ä¢ How to wire and program physical light switches
‚Ä¢ How to read temperature & humidity data from a sensor
‚Ä¢ How to pair ESP32 directly with Apple HomeKit
‚Ä¢ How to control devices via Apple Home, Siri, and physical switches

üëçThis project is perfect if you love DIY Smart Home, want a budget-friendly Apple HomeKit device, and prefer to keep everything private & under your control.

4. Code:
   - Please change GPIO follow your pins:
     In HOMEKIT8_3_BEDROOM_DHT.ino file: 
     // Pin assignments for each light
        #define LIGHT1_OUT 10
        #define LIGHT2_OUT 11
        #define LIGHT1_IN   12
        #define LIGHT2_IN   13
     In DHT22_Sens file:
     // -------- DHT Sensor Configuration --------
        #define DHTPIN 5
        #define DHTTYPE DHT22
  - This project also includes optimized sampling intervals for both the toggle switches and the DHT22 sensor, ensuring fast response and reliable data updates. You can change the reading cycle if you want
     const int SW_INTERVAL= 50;  // milliseconds, reading cycle of toggle switch
     const int DHT_INTERVAL = 5000;  // milliseconds, reading cycle of DHT22 sensor
