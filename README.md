🚀 In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to set up a DIY smart switch &amp; and temperature &amp; humidity sensor module for a typical bedroom — with 2 light switches and 1 temperature &amp; humidity sensor — all connected directly to Apple HomeKit. No hub required! 🔥

What you’ll be able to do:
✅ 2 physical light switches (works with both switch & Home app)
✅ Temperature & humidity sensor for real-time room monitoring
✅ Direct Apple HomeKit integration — works with Siri voice control
✅ 100% local network setup, fully private & secure

You don’t need to be an expert in coding or electronics. I explain everything clearly so anyone can follow along.

📌 What you’ll learn in this video:
• How to configure an ESP32 as a HomeKit device
• How to wire and program physical light switches
• How to read temperature & humidity data from a sensor
• How to pair ESP32 directly with Apple HomeKit
